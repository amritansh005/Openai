    "This research engagement successfully demonstrates that **systematic academic frameworks** can identify research-significant patterns with **{avg_score:.2f}/10 average academic scoring** and **{sum(1 for f in self.findings if f.competition_score() >= 6)}/{len(self.findings)} research-standard findings** across **{len(all_categories)} supported vulnerability categories**. The methodology represents **advancement in academic AI safety research**, providing systematic approaches while maintaining rigorous educational standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dynamic theoretical analysis framework** provides a **fully reproducible, scalable approach** to AI safety education that can be applied across all 9 competition vulnerability categories. This work advances both practical research capabilities and methodological understanding of systematic AI analysis for educational purposes.\n",
